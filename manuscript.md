## Key Points

1. Most stem CH₄ studies do not measure above 2 m, sampling across ~1% or less of total tree surface area.
2. Above 2 m, uptake is infrequent (6–7% of observations) and emission hotspots are sometimes observed, suggesting flux magnitude is not always a simple function of height.
3. Whole-tree CH₄ budgets are highly sensitive to unmeasured fluxes at height; expanded vertically resolved measurements across species and ecosystems are needed.

## Abstract

The role of trees in methane (CH₄) budgets remains uncertain, with some studies suggesting flux direction reverses with height. We combined ground-to-canopy measurements from seven temperate trees with a reanalysis of 50 published studies to evaluate height-flux relationships. In our field data (141 measurements), fluxes declined 3.4-fold above 2 m but remained predominantly positive; only 6% of above-2 m stem observations were negative, and discrete emission hotspots occurred at height. In the published literature, only 20% of studies included measurements at or above 2 m, and negative fluxes at these heights were infrequent. Because most tree surface area resides above commonly sampled heights, whole-tree CH₄ budgets are sensitive to assumptions and extrapolations to these surfaces; an illustrative scaling exercise shows branches and leaves dominate the integrated flux despite low per-area rates. Expanded ground-to-canopy observations are needed to constrain trees' role in methane budgets.

## Plain Language Summary

Trees transport methane from the soil to the atmosphere, contributing to greenhouse gas budgets. Most measurements of methane release from trees are taken near the base of the trunk, below about 2 meters. Some researchers have proposed that tree surfaces higher up may actually absorb methane from the air, which would mean trees play a very different role in climate than currently assumed.

We measured methane fluxes from the bases to the canopy tops of seven trees in New England forests, reaching heights up to 22 meters, and reanalyzed data from 50 published studies. We found that methane emissions decrease with height but almost always remain positive—meaning trees mostly emit rather than absorb methane across the heights measured. Only about 6% of our above-2-meter measurements showed any uptake, and the published literature showed a similar pattern.

Critically, most of a tree's surface area is in its branches and leaves, which have rarely been measured for methane flux. A simple scaling exercise shows that these canopy surfaces can dominate the whole-tree methane budget despite low per-area rates. More measurements extending from the ground into the canopy are needed to determine whether trees are net methane sources or sinks.

## 1. Introduction

Trees transport methane (CH₄) from the subsurface to the atmosphere. Over the past two decades, studies have documented CH₄ emissions from tree stems across ecosystems ranging from tropical wetlands to temperate upland forests (Pangala et al., 2017; Covey et al., 2012; Barba et al., 2019; Gauci, 2025). In wetlands, these emissions are thought to originate primarily from methanogenesis in anoxic soil microsites, with CH₄ transported upward through the xylem or bark tissues and released through the stem surface (Covey & Megonigal, 2019), though internal methanogenesis within heartwood can also contribute in wetlands and uplands alike (Wang et al., 2016; Gewirtzman et al., 2025).

A consistent observation across this literature is that stem CH₄ fluxes decline with measurement height. Fluxes measured near the base of the tree (typically below 1–2 m) tend to be substantially larger than those measured higher on the stem, particularly in wetlands. This pattern is generally attributed to the proximity of lower stem surfaces to the soil CH₄ source and to the potential for diffusive loss and oxidation during upward transport, though internal methanogenesis within wood tissues can also produce localized emissions at height (Mochidome et al., 2025).

Recently, several authors have extended this declining-flux pattern to suggest that tree surfaces may switch from net emission to net uptake at canopy heights (Gauci et al., 2024, 2025). Gauci et al. (2024) reported net CH₄ uptake on woody surfaces above approximately 2 m in tropical, temperate, and boreal forests and estimated a global woody-surface CH₄ sink of 24.6–49.9 Tg yr⁻¹. Jeffrey et al. (2021a) demonstrated that methane-oxidizing bacteria residing in tree bark can reduce net stem CH₄ emissions, with some conditions leading to net methane uptake (Leung et al., 2026). Other studies have reported net CH₄ oxidation by stems or foliage under certain conditions (Machacova et al., 2021; Gorgolewski et al., 2023a). If higher-stem or canopy net uptake is widespread, it would affect how tree CH₄ fluxes are scaled to landscape and global levels, since a tree that emits at the base but absorbs CH₄ across its canopy surface area would have a substantially different net flux than one estimated from basal measurements alone. However, most tree surface area (stems, branches, and leaves) resides above the heights at which measurements are typically made (Gewirtzman, 2026).

Here we evaluate the evidence for a source-sink transition with height. We show that the empirical basis for canopy-height CH₄ uptake is limited, and that the measurements which do exist mostly do not yet support it, though more notably, measurements are lacking in the spatial locales (ecosystems, vertical extents, tree tissues) that might most likely host such a process.

## 2. Methods

### 2.1 Field measurements

We measured CH₄ fluxes on tree stems, branches, and leaves at two sites: Harvard Forest (Petersham, MA; 42.53°N, 72.19°W) and Yale Myers Forest (Union, CT). At Harvard Forest, six trees of four species (*Acer rubrum*, *Nyssa sylvatica*, *Quercus rubra*, and *Tsuga canadensis*) were measured on 18–19 July and 16–17 August 2023. Heights ranged from ground level to 22 m. The upper canopy was accessed using a canopy aerial lift (DinoLift). At Yale Myers Forest, a single mature *Quercus velutina* was measured on 4 October 2022 at seven heights along the stem (0.5, 1.25, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 m), with heights above 2 m accessed via arborist climbing equipment.

### 2.2 Chamber fluxes

Stem and branch CH₄ fluxes were measured using rigid static chambers constructed from transparent plastic containers (Rubbermaid) with arcs cut to conform to the surface, with chamber sizes ranging from 0.5 to 2.0 L to accommodate variation in stem and branch diameter. Chamber volumes were determined by gas standard dilution in the laboratory (Jeffrey et al., 2021b; Siegenthaler et al., 2016). Enclosed surface area was calculated as the product of the chamber's planar area and arc length. Chambers were sealed to stems and branches using potting clay (Amaco) and secured with lashing straps. Seal integrity was verified by visual inspection, by blowing on the chamber perimeter and monitoring for CO₂ spikes, and by checking concentration linearity during measurement.

Leaf fluxes were measured by enclosing branch tips in clear Rubbermaid containers with a notch cut in the rim to accommodate the branch. The lid, fitted with a rubber gasket, was sealed and the notch filled with potting clay. Leaves were kept at as close to their natural angle as possible and exposed to ambient light. After measurement, the enclosed material was cut and leaf surface area was measured with a LI-COR 3100C leaf area meter; in cases where leaves were lost before measurement, area was estimated as the species mean from other measurements in the dataset. These chambers were not controlled for temperature, vapor pressure deficit, or gas concentration, so leaf flux rates should be interpreted as coarse estimates of flux sign and relative magnitude rather than precise physiological rates.

Chambers were connected via 5 mm internal-diameter PVC tubing (Bev-a-Line) to a portable off-axis integrated cavity output spectroscopy (OA-ICOS) analyzer (GLA131-GGA, Los Gatos Research) measuring CO₂, CH₄, and H₂O concentrations at 1 Hz with CH₄ precision <0.9 ppb. The analyzer's 5 L min⁻¹ flow rate provided complete chamber volume turnover within approximately 30 s. Measurements lasted 3–10 min per location, with the initial 30 s excluded to allow equilibration.

### 2.3 Flux calculation

CH₄ and CO₂ fluxes were calculated using the goFlux R package (Rheault et al., 2024), which fits linear and non-linear (Hutchinson-Mosier) models to chamber headspace concentration time series with automatic water vapor correction (Hutchinson & Mosier, 1981; Hüppi et al., 2018). Air temperature and barometric pressure were obtained from the Fisher Meteorological Station at Harvard Forest (Boose & VanScoy, 2026) and matched to each measurement by timestamp. Best-fit model selection used goFlux quality criteria including goodness-of-fit metrics, physical constraints (g-factor < 2.0; κ/κ_max ≤ 1.0), and statistical thresholds (P < 0.05; flux > minimal detectable flux). CO₂ flux R² served as a chamber seal quality metric.

### 2.4 Wu et al. (2024) reanalysis

We reanalyzed the compiled dataset from Wu et al. (2024), accessed from the supplementary material of the original publication (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2024.109976). The dataset contains observations from 50 studies across upland and wetland ecosystems. We used the "upland-stem" and "wetland-stem" sheets, which together contain 1,010 observations with associated measurement heights and CH₄ flux values.

Measurement heights reported as ranges (e.g., "2–4") were converted to their midpoint. Observations with missing height or flux values were excluded. We classified each study by its maximum reported measurement height and tallied observations at or above height thresholds of 2, 5, and 10 m. To characterize vertical flux structure, we fit per-study linear and exponential regressions of normalized flux against height, partitioning studies into those with all measurements below 2 m and those extending above; details and slope-fitting criteria are provided in the Supporting Information (Text S1). All reanalysis code is available in the project repository.

### 2.5 Software

All analyses were conducted in R. Flux calculations used goFlux (Rheault et al., 2024). Data processing used dplyr, readr, tidyr, stringr, lubridate, readxl, and openxlsx. Figures were produced with ggplot2 and patchwork. The truncation model was computed analytically in R.

## 3. Results

### 3.1 Field measurements

The combined dataset from Harvard Forest and Yale Myers Forest (Section 2) comprises 141 measurements on seven trees of five species, including 109 stem, 11 branch, and 21 leaf measurements spanning heights from ground level to 22 m.

Consistent with prior work, mean CH₄ flux was substantially higher below 2 m (0.88 nmol m⁻² s⁻¹, n = 26) than at or above 2 m (0.26 nmol m⁻² s⁻¹, n = 115), a ratio of 3.4×. For stems alone, the mean was 0.95 nmol m⁻² s⁻¹ below 2 m (n = 24) and 0.33 nmol m⁻² s⁻¹ at or above 2 m (n = 77); mean branch and leaf fluxes were 0.23 (n = 11) and 0.02 (n = 21) nmol m⁻² s⁻¹, respectively. Fluxes generally declined with height (Figure 1), but the decline was not uniformly monotonic. Discrete hotspots (localized zones of elevated emission) were observed at various heights along some stems; in 3 of 7 trees, the single highest flux occurred above 5 m, even though the largest fluxes in the overall dataset were concentrated at the stem base.

Points are colored by component (stem, branch, leaf). LOESS smooths are fitted to stem measurements only. The dashed vertical line indicates zero flux. (b) Oak tree at Yale Myers Forest; heights range from 0.5 to 10 m. (c) Canopy access via aerial lift (DinoLift) at Harvard Forest. (d) Arborist climbing at Yale Myers Forest. Fluxes are predominantly positive at all heights in both datasets.

However, the declining fluxes did not cross zero. Among 83 stem measurements at or above 2 m, only 5 were negative (6.0%). At higher thresholds, the results are similar: at ≥5 m, 5 of 61 measurements (8.2%) were negative; at ≥10 m, 4 of 31 (12.9%). All seven trees are represented at every height threshold, so this pattern is not driven by sampling bias toward particular individuals.

Branch and leaf fluxes were small in magnitude. Median branch flux was 0.070 nmol m⁻² s⁻¹ (n = 11) and median leaf flux was 0.007 nmol m⁻² s⁻¹ (n = 21). Both were predominantly positive, though leaf fluxes in particular should be interpreted cautiously given the uncontrolled chamber conditions (Section 2.2).

On a per-tree basis, no individual showed a consistent pattern of net uptake at height. The tree with the highest proportion of negative fluxes above 2 m was a *Tsuga canadensis* individual with 4 of 13 measurements negative (30.8%), but even this tree had a majority of positive fluxes. Most trees had few or no negative measurements at height.

### 3.2 Reanalysis of above-2 m literature data

Using the Wu et al. (2024) synthesis (Section 2.4; 1,010 observations from 50 studies), we classified each study by its maximum measurement height. The measurement record is heavily truncated: only 10 of 50 studies (20%) include any measurements at or above 2 m. Coverage thins further at greater heights: 3 studies (6%) measured at or above 5 m, and none reached 10 m. The maximum measurement height in the entire compilation is 8.0 m.

We examined the 127 above-2 m observations from these 10 studies (Figure 2). Of these, 9 were negative (7.1%), similar to the 6.0% in our own data. At ≥5 m, there were 12 observations across 3 studies, and none were negative.

![Figure 2](figures/figure3_wu_reanalysis.png)

> **Figure 2.** Above-2 m CH₄ flux observations from the Wu et al. (2024) synthesis, faceted by study (including all 10 studies with measurements at ≥2 m). Points are colored by ecosystem type (upland/wetland). LOESS smooths are shown per study. Fluxes decline with height but remain predominantly positive across the literature.

No study in the compilation had a majority of negative fluxes at or above 2 m. Across these 10 studies, spanning boreal, temperate, and tropical ecosystems, the proportion of negative fluxes at height ranges from 0 to 20%.

Among studies measuring only below 2 m, the vertical decline is universal: all 19 qualifying studies show negative normalized-flux-versus-height slopes, with exponential half-lives of 0.1–1.2 m, meaning flux per unit bark area drops steeply within the first meter (Table S1; Figure S1). Among studies extending above 2 m, per-study linear slopes tested against zero show that upland fluxes flatten (mean slope = +0.01, p = 0.96) while wetland fluxes remain significantly declining with height (mean slope = −0.50, p = 0.016; Table S2; Figure S2). Across both our new data and the existing literature, the above-2 m measurement record shows declining but predominantly positive CH₄ fluxes.

## 4. Discussion

### 4.1 The surface area scaling problem

To put these measurement heights in perspective, we modeled a representative temperate deciduous tree as a cone with a height of 26 m and a DBH of 40 cm. Using the surface area partitioning of Whittaker and Woodwell (1967), which gives ratios of 0.45 m² m⁻² for stem bark, 1.70 m² m⁻² for branch bark, and 4.5 m² m⁻² (leaf area index) for leaves, we calculated cumulative capture fractions for three nested surface area denominators: stem only, stem plus branches, and stem plus branches plus leaves (Figure 3).

At 2 m, the height below which most existing measurements are concentrated, one has sampled 14.8% of the stem surface area, 3.1% of stem-plus-branch area, and 1.0% of total tree surface area (stem, branches, and leaves). At 10 m, these fractions reach 62.1%, 13.0%, and 4.2%, respectively (Figure 3b,c). Most of a tree's surface area is in the branches and leaves of the upper canopy, which has rarely been measured.

The scaling implication is straightforward: because most surface area lies above the heights at which fluxes are typically measured, the whole-tree methane balance depends disproportionately on assumptions about canopy fluxes. If canopy surfaces are assumed to take up methane, the net tree flux can shift toward neutrality or even become a sink. If canopy fluxes remain small but positive, the tree remains a source. Because this large canopy-area term is largely unmeasured, different extrapolation choices can produce different whole-tree flux directions. Current observations show declining flux with height, but they do not demonstrate a sign reversal across the canopy.

An illustrative stand-level budget puts concrete numbers to this sensitivity (Figure 3d–f). Using our observed per-tissue flux rates and the Whittaker and Woodwell (1967) surface area indices for a single representative tree, stem surfaces below 2 m account for only 9% of the stand-integrated CH₄ flux, while branches (56%) and leaves (16%) dominate the budget despite their lower per-area flux rates. Under these assumptions, a uniform canopy uptake of just −0.01 nmol m⁻² s⁻¹ across all >2 m surfaces would suffice to cancel the entire below-2 m emission, whereas the observed area-weighted mean is an order of magnitude higher and positive (0.09 nmol m⁻² s⁻¹). These specific numbers reflect a small sample of temperate trees measured during the growing season, and both the absolute flux rates and their relative balance across tissues will vary with species, season, and environmental conditions. The exercise nonetheless illustrates a general point: because canopy surfaces so greatly exceed basal stem area, the scaling question is not only whether uptake occurs, but whether it is sufficiently large and spatially consistent to outweigh basal emissions when integrated over the whole tree.

(e) Harvard Forest stand-level integrated tree CH₄ flux (flux rate × area index). (f) Scaling sensitivity: the uniform flux across all >2 m surfaces that would be required to double, cancel, or flip the sign of the below-2 m emission, and the observed area-weighted mean (dashed red line). This budget is illustrative; absolute rates and their relative balance will vary across species, seasons, and conditions.

### 4.2 Gross fluxes, net fluxes, and the role of bark microbiota

Tree bark hosts abundant and metabolically active microbial communities capable of both producing and consuming CH₄, with net surface flux reflecting the balance of these competing processes. Evidence for methanotrophic activity on bark is increasingly well-established: Jeffrey et al. (2021a) showed that bark-dwelling methanotrophs reduce stem emissions by 36 ± 5%, and Gewirtzman et al. (2025) show net fluxes are best predicted by the ratio of methanogen to methanotroph abundance across stem cross-sectional area. Leung et al. (2026) characterized bark microbiota across eight Australian tree species, confirming that bark microorganisms aerobically consume CH₄ and that methanotrophs can coexist with methanogens, with the net surface flux reflecting a dynamic balance that shifts with redox conditions and substrate availability.

From an atmospheric perspective, gross CH₄ oxidation by bark microbiota matters independently of whether the net surface flux crosses zero. Even when a stem emits CH₄ overall, microbial oxidation within the bark attenuates that emission relative to what would otherwise reach the atmosphere, an effect functionally equivalent to uptake from ambient air. Analogous dynamics are well-documented in soils and landfill systems, where gross oxidation substantially exceeds net uptake and represents an important constraint on emissions even when the surface remains a net source (Le Mer & Roger, 2001; Segers, 1998; Scheutz et al., 2009). Such dynamics are important in trees irrespective of the net direction of fluxes (Gewirtzman et al., 2025; Jeffrey et al., 2021a).

What the current measurement record does not yet demonstrate is that net atmospheric CH₄ uptake is a consistent or widespread feature of tree canopies. Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence: the canopy surfaces where uptake might be most prevalent remain almost entirely unmeasured, and the microbial machinery for oxidation is clearly present. But resolving this question has consequences beyond scientific completeness. Whether tree surfaces are a meaningful CH₄ sink or bark microbiota merely attenuate emissions without driving net uptake, both outcomes change how tree CH₄ fluxes should be represented in models. In either case, trees cannot be properly incorporated into global CH₄ budgets until canopy-height fluxes are empirically established.

### 4.3 Complications to simple height-flux models

Our data show complications for smooth monotonic decline models. The presence of discrete hotspots (sensu McClain et al., 2003; Bernhardt et al., 2017) well above the stem base, including 3 of 7 trees in which the highest flux occurred above 5 m, indicates that height alone does not determine flux magnitude. This is consistent with Mochidome et al. (2025), who demonstrated that local methanogenesis within upper trunk tissues can drive emissions at heights of 4–12 m, with 44–89% of total trunk CH₄ emissions originating above 3 m. Mochidome and Epron (2024) documented up to 15-fold intra-individual spatial variation in trunk CH₄ fluxes, driven largely by variation in sapwood CH₄ production rates. Wounds and branches can also be significant emission sources (Gorgolewski et al., 2023b).

A plausible explanation for such hotspots is the axial progression of wood decay within living stems. Decay commonly develops in longitudinal columns extending vertically from points of infection or wounding (Shigo, 1984; Boddy, 2001), and recent sonic tomography evidence demonstrates significant height-dependent differences in decay occurrence consistent with vertical progression along the trunk (Tarmu et al., 2025). Localized anaerobic microsites associated with vertically distributed decay may foster methanogenesis within wood, consistent with early evidence for methane formation in oxygen-limited heartwood (Zeikus & Ward, 1974), observations of elevated trace gases in decaying wood (Covey et al., 2016), and demonstrations that methanogens are common inhabitants of heartwood and sapwood across diverse tree species (Yip et al., 2018; Feng et al., 2021; Harada et al., 2024; Putkinen et al., 2021; Gewirtzman et al., 2025) whose abundance and activity partially explain variability in stem emissions. Integrating structural diagnostics such as sonic tomography with vertically resolved flux measurements represents a clear direction for future research.

Our field data are limited to seven trees at two temperate forest sites in the northeastern United States, measured during the growing season. We cannot rule out the possibility that uptake is more prevalent in other biomes, seasons, or environmental conditions. The measurements are also snapshots in time rather than continuous records, and fluxes may vary diurnally and seasonally. These same limitations apply to the studies that have been cited as evidence for canopy-height uptake. Notably, the expectation is that canopy-height uptake would be strongest in the tropics (Gauci et al., 2024), perhaps due to enabling factors such as persistent bark moisture, but more information is needed about variation within and between forest types and ecoclimatic zones before generalizations can be drawn. More broadly, the direction and mechanisms of foliar CH₄ exchange remain unresolved, likely reflecting a balance of abiotic production (e.g., UV-driven; Kohl et al., 2023), microbial methanogenesis in wet vegetation niches, endophytic methanotrophy (Gorgolewski et al., 2023a), and transport (Wang et al., 2025).

### 4.4 Toward whole-tree flux constraints

**Table 1.** Qualitative uncertainty in scaling whole-tree CH₄ fluxes.

| Component | Surface area certainty | Flux certainty | State of knowledge |
|---|---|---|---|
| Lower stem (≤2 m) | Relatively high | Moderate | Frequently measured; simple geometry |
| Upper stem (>2 m) | Relatively high | Low | Sparse vertical measurements |
| Branches | Low | Low | Architecture complex; limited area and flux data |
| Leaves | High (LAI-based) | Low | Leaf area index known; direct CH₄ flux data rare |

Uncertainty in whole-tree scaling is dominated by canopy components. Lower-stem flux has been measured extensively, but upper-stem, branch, and leaf fluxes remain sparsely quantified despite comprising most of total tree surface area. The least constrained terms in the scaling equation correspond to the largest surface areas.

Resolving the question of canopy-height CH₄ fluxes will require a different measurement approach: continuous or repeated measurements at multiple heights on the same trees, extending from the base into the upper canopy and including branches and leaves. As Gauci (2025) emphasizes, tree CH₄ exchange responses to environmental changes remain poorly quantified, and reducing uncertainty in the global CH₄ budget requires better spatial and temporal coverage. Automated chamber systems on canopy towers or accessed via tree-climbing techniques could provide the resolution needed to detect whether and when uptake occurs. Pairing flux measurements with characterization of bark-associated microbial communities (Jeffrey et al., 2021a; Gewirtzman et al., 2025) would help connect observed flux patterns to their biological drivers.

Independent constraints could, in principle, be obtained by combining eddy covariance (EC) measurements of net ecosystem CH₄ exchange with bottom-up inventories of other sources and sinks, inferring the tree contribution as the residual (e.g., Shoemaker et al., 2014; Bréchet et al., 2025; Mander et al., 2021, 2022). However, because the residual reflects the combined uncertainty of all component fluxes—including EC filtering, spatial heterogeneity in soil emissions, and footprint mismatches—and because branch and leaf surfaces remain sparsely measured, canopy exchange may remain weakly constrained in such budgets. Coordinated, vertically resolved tree measurements would strengthen ecosystem-scale partitioning efforts.

Surface area itself is under-constrained in many scaling exercises: stem area can be estimated geometrically, but branch surface area is poorly quantified despite often exceeding stem area. Terrestrial LiDAR and structure-from-motion photogrammetry offer a path toward empirically constraining woody surface area in whole-tree CH₄ budgets (Gewirtzman, 2026).

## 5. Conclusions

Whether tree canopies function as net CH₄ sources, sinks, or both likely varies across species, ecosystems, and seasons, and resolving this question requires measurements that extend into the portions of the tree where most surface area resides. Vertically resolved observations from seven trees measured to 22 m, together with reanalysis of published above-2 m data, show declining fluxes with height that remain predominantly positive across the profiles examined. Net uptake occurs intermittently but does not emerge as a consistent canopy-scale pattern in these observations. At the same time, we continue to find evidence that bark-associated methanotrophs are active. Canopy surfaces remain sparsely sampled, and expanding ground-to-canopy flux measurements, particularly when paired with microbial characterization and ecosystem-scale constraints, would allow canopy contributions to be evaluated directly rather than inferred. Because branches and leaves dominate the stand-level surface area budget, such efforts would disproportionately reduce uncertainty in scaling tree methane exchange from stems to forests and improve representation of trees in methane budgets.

## Text S1. Extended Wu et al. (2024) reanalysis

To characterize the vertical structure of stem CH₄ fluxes across the published literature, we performed slope-fitting analyses on the Wu et al. (2024) compilation, partitioning studies into those with all measurements below 2 m and those extending to 2 m or above.

### S1.1 Below-2 m studies

Of the 40 studies with all measurements below 2 m (700 observations total), 19 passed slope-fitting criteria requiring ≥0.5 m height range, ≥3 unique measurement heights, and no single measurement gap exceeding 80% of the total height range. Within-study fluxes were normalized by dividing each observation by the study's mean absolute flux, allowing comparison of vertical trends across studies with different flux magnitudes.

Both linear and exponential models were fit to the normalized flux-height relationship for each study, and the distribution of per-study slopes was tested against zero using one-sample t-tests. Every one of the 19 qualifying studies showed a negative slope, indicating that the vertical decline in stem CH₄ flux near the base is universal across the measurement record (Table S1; Figure S1). The mean linear slope was −1.48 (p = 2.2 × 10⁻⁵), with wetland studies showing steeper decline (mean = −2.00, p = 0.0002) than upland studies (mean = −0.77, p = 0.006).

Exponential decay consistently provided a better fit than linear decline (lower AIC in both ecosystems). Exponential half-lives ranged from 0.1 to 0.6 m in wetlands and 0.2 to 1.2 m in uplands, indicating that flux per unit bark area drops sharply within the first meter of the trunk. The steeper wetland decay rates (~2–3× those of uplands) are consistent with stronger belowground CH₄ source strength driving sharper near-surface efflux gradients.

### S1.2 Above-2 m studies

Ten studies included measurements at or above 2 m. Fluxes were normalized as above (each observation divided by the study's mean absolute flux). We analyzed height-flux relationships across the full height range of each study and, where data permitted, within the below-2 m window alone (Table S2; Figure S2). Per-study slopes were tested against zero using one-sample t-tests.

Only 4 of 10 studies had sufficient below-2 m data to fit slopes within that window; the resulting mean slope was not significant (p = 0.43).

Across the full height range of all 10 studies, upland slopes were essentially flat (mean linear slope = +0.01, p = 0.96), while wetland slopes remained significantly negative (mean = −0.50, p = 0.016). Pooled wetland exponential regression yielded a half-life of ~1.2 m (p = 2.8 × 10⁻⁹). These results indicate that in uplands, fluxes level off above 2 m without reversing sign, while in wetlands, vertical decline continues throughout the measured stem height.

### S1.3 Implications for scaling

The steep near-base gradient documented across the literature means that measurements taken only at low stem heights will overestimate whole-tree CH₄ efflux if scaled uniformly to total stem surface area. Conversely, the flattening of upland slopes above 2 m indicates no directional trend with height, though localized hotspots (Section 4.3) mean that individual fluxes can still vary substantially along the stem. These patterns reinforce the importance of vertically resolved measurements for whole-tree scaling, as discussed in the main text.

## Table S1. Height-flux slope statistics for below-2 m studies (n = 19)

| Ecosystem | N studies | Model | Mean slope/decay | Median | t-test p |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Upland | 8 | Linear | −0.77 | −0.53 | 0.006 |
| Upland | 8 | Exponential | −1.07 | −0.88 | 0.017 |
| Wetland | 11 | Linear | −2.00 | −1.47 | 0.0002 |
| Wetland | 11 | Exponential | −2.71 | −2.22 | 0.0006 |
| All | 19 | Linear | −1.48 | −0.91 | 2.2 × 10⁻⁵ |
| All | 19 | Exponential | −2.02 | −1.34 | 6.3 × 10⁻⁵ |

Slopes are computed from within-study regressions of normalized flux (flux / study mean absolute flux) against height. Exponential decay rates are from log-transformed regressions. The t-test p-values are from one-sample tests of the per-study slopes against zero. All 19 studies show negative slopes.

## Table S2. Height-flux slope statistics for above-2 m studies (n = 10)

| Height window | Ecosystem | N studies | Mean linear slope | p |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Below 2 m only | All | 4 | −0.87 | 0.43 |
| Full range | Upland | 5 | +0.01 | 0.96 |
| Full range | Wetland | 5 | −0.50 | 0.016 |
| Full range | All | 10 | −0.25 | 0.13 |

Points are colored by height zone: brown for below 2 m, green for at or above 2 m. Four regression lines are shown per study where data permit: full-range linear (solid blue), full-range exponential (solid dark red), below-2 m linear extended to the full height range (dashed brown), and below-2 m exponential extended (dashed ochre). Dotted vertical and horizontal lines mark zero flux and 2 m height, respectively. Upland full-range slopes are essentially flat, while wetland slopes remain negative.
